            <h1>Allyson Suandi</h1>
            <p>My name is Allyson Suandi and I am a junior studying computer science with a minor in UX design at the University of Michigan. Growing up, I always wanted to create something that would help serve people. My childhood notebooks are filled with little robots that I drew and elaborate descriptions of all of their functions. My goal is to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives through technology and design.
